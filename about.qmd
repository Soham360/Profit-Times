# About the Author

Hi, I’m Soham, a student satirist trying to make the world laugh… and think.  

This site highlights moments where profit seems more important than people, sometimes in ways so absurd they could only be real if they weren’t.  

All articles are meant to entertain and provoke thought, with a touch of humor.
