# Local School Sells Naming Rights to Cafeteria

In a groundbreaking education-meets-advertising initiative, Lincoln High has sold the naming rights to its cafeteria.  

Students now eat lunch under banners proudly sponsored by SnackCorp™, SodaBlast™, and MysteryEnergyDrink™. “We thought it would motivate students to learn,” said the principal. “Who doesn’t want to study when every bite comes with a brand endorsement?”  

Parents are reportedly thrilled that their children are being prepared for a corporate future—one lunch at a time.
