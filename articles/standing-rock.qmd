# Standing Rock: Protests Threaten Nation’s Bottom Line 

STANDING ROCK, ND — Local and national businesses are reportedly "deeply concerned" this week as the Standing Rock protests continue to delay what could have been another record-breaking quarter for corporations. Experts warn that these protests, led by people calling themselves “activists,” are standing in the way of progress, growth, and most importantly, profits.

“Every hour that pipeline construction is stalled, we’re losing money,” said a spokesperson for a company involved in the project. “We understand there’s an environmental impact and some people have feelings, but feelings don’t pay dividends. We just want to make America wealthy again—one oil pipeline at a time.”

Protesters argue that the pipeline threatens water supplies and sacred lands, but corporate leaders maintain that the real tragedy is that delayed construction is bad for business. “We’ve got quarterly reports to worry about,” said another executive. “If the water is safe or if sacred sites are preserved, that’s great, but if it doesn’t fit into a profit margin, we have to reassess our priorities.”

Meanwhile, local communities have been encouraged to “think about the bigger picture,” namely the increased stock value of oil companies and the possibility of shareholders receiving slightly higher bonuses this year. One corporate analyst noted, “We’re just trying to balance the budget here. Protecting water? Important. Protecting profits? Even more important.”

Some economists suggest that the protests might even inspire innovation in the private sector, such as developing pipelines that can carry oil faster or designing shareholder-friendly environmental impact studies. “If these protests have taught us anything, it’s that people are stubborn,” said the analyst. “And we can turn that stubbornness into, well, money.”

As the standoff continues, corporate leaders remain hopeful that eventually, the protests will realize the futility of prioritizing morality over financial gains. Until then, shareholders are urged to stay patient and remember: in the battle between ethics and earnings, earnings always win.
