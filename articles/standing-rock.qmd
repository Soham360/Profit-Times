# Standing Rock: A Pipeline of Profits  

In what analysts have proudly labeled a breakthrough in combining environmental denial with financial ambition, the Standing Rock protests have reminded the nation of a simple principle: people are important until they interfere with revenue.  

While hundreds gathered to defend sacred land and clean water, corporate leaders stayed focused on the real issue, which was the projected gain on next year’s earnings report. “We absolutely hear the concerns of Indigenous communities,” said one executive from a conference room decorated with inspirational posters about synergy, “which is why we scheduled a meeting to consider scheduling another meeting about it.”  

Protesters showed up with determination, handmade signs, and a sense of responsibility for future generations. They were met with the unstoppable force of investment capital, which arrives quietly and grows loudly. Pipelines do not wait for ethics reviews. They only wait for construction permits and favorable market conditions.  

Local officials explained that they deeply respect cultural heritage but also respect the budget surplus the pipeline might bring. “Water is precious,” said one official while reviewing financial charts, “but these revenue projections are truly beautiful.”  

Investors held early celebrations, toasting with champagne and discussing how efficiently profits can travel when obstacles like morality are removed. The choice between people and profit has never been difficult for them. Profit never argues back and always shows up on time.
