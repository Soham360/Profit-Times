STANDING ROCK, ND — Shareholders and executives are expressing “extreme concern” this week as reports of violent clashes at the Standing Rock protests threaten what could have been another uninterrupted season of corporate growth. Experts say that confrontations between protesters and law enforcement are creating “unnecessary volatility” in the region’s profit potential.

“Every tear gas canister fired is a potential disruption to our quarterly earnings,” said a spokesperson for a major pipeline company. “We acknowledge that clashes can be dramatic and even newsworthy, but news doesn’t pay dividends. We’d prefer calm, predictable profits over chaotic headlines any day.”  

Protesters argue that they are defending sacred lands and clean water, but corporate leaders insist that the real casualties are lost work hours and delayed revenue streams. “Yes, property damage is unfortunate, but have you considered the compounded opportunity cost?” asked one executive. “Water and land are cool and all, but our spreadsheets are sacred. We've depended on these for years!”

Local business analysts have suggested that the violence could have a small silver lining, potentially inspiring the private sector to innovate in crowd-control technology, shareholder-friendly insurance packages, or “protester-resistant” pipeline designs. “If people are going to get in the way of our revenue, we might as well monetize it,” said an analyst.

As tensions rise, executives remain optimistic. Plans are underway for investor workshops on “weathering protest-related turbulence” and motivational seminars titled “Why Ethics Should Never Interrupt Earnings.” Meanwhile, protesters continue to clash with law enforcement, seemingly unaware that the real tragedy is the delayed dividend payments.  

Ultimately, the message to shareholders is clear: in the battle between chaos and cash, cash always wins.
