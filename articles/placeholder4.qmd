# Man Starts Fundraising Campaign to Fund Fundraising Campaigns

In what may be the most meta fundraising initiative of the decade, local entrepreneur Brad Moneybags launched a campaign to fund future campaigns.  

“I realized people love giving money, but only if it’s organized by someone else,” Moneybags explained. “So I’m creating the ultimate fundraising fund.”  

Supporters are reportedly impressed by the efficiency and innovation of raising funds to raise more funds—a process some are calling “profit inception.”
