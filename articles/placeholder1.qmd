# Mayor Turns City Hall into Luxury Hotel

In an unprecedented move blending politics and real estate, the mayor has converted City Hall into a five-star luxury hotel.  

Residents are reportedly confused about where to pay their parking tickets, but investors are ecstatic. “We see untapped potential in civic real estate,” said one hotel manager. “Why have a council meeting when you can have a spa day?”  

The public is encouraged to book early, especially for the penthouse, formerly the mayor's office, now offering skyline views and complimentary lobbying advice.
