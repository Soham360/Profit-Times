# Corporation Discovers New Mineral: Pure Capitalism

Scientists were stunned when researchers at MegaCorp Labs announced the discovery of a new mineral: Pure Capitalism.  

The mineral is reportedly shiny, highly malleable, and incredibly rare—perfect for forging new business ventures and stock portfolios. “We’ve already patented it,” said a spokesperson. “It’s amazing what you can do when the planet is just a resource for profit.”  

Environmentalists are unconcerned, citing their limited capacity to compete with billion-dollar marketing campaigns.
