    "text": "Standing Rock Violence Disrupts Profit Flow\n\nWritten by Soham Kamat\n\nSTANDING ROCK, ND — Shareholders and executives are expressing “extreme concern” this week as reports of violent clashes at the Standing Rock protests threaten what could have been another uninterrupted season of corporate growth. Experts say that confrontations between protesters and law enforcement are creating “unnecessary volatility” in the region’s profit potential.\n\n\n\nScene from Standing Rock protests.\n\n\n“Every tear gas canister fired is a potential disruption to our quarterly earnings,” said a spokesperson for a major pipeline company. “We acknowledge that clashes can be dramatic and even newsworthy, but news doesn’t pay dividends. We’d prefer calm, predictable profits over chaotic headlines any day.”\nProtesters argue that they are defending sacred lands and clean water, but corporate leaders insist that the real casualties are lost work hours and delayed revenue streams. “Yes, property damage is unfortunate, but have you considered the compounded opportunity cost?” asked one executive. “Water and land are cool and all, but our spreadsheets are sacred. We’ve depended on these for years!”\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement at Standing Rock protests.\n\n\nLocal business analysts have suggested that the violence could have a small silver lining, potentially inspiring the private sector to innovate in crowd-control technology, shareholder-friendly insurance packages, or “protester-resistant” pipeline designs. “If people are going to get in the way of our revenue, we might as well monetize it,” said an analyst.\n\n\n\nProtests escalating into confrontations.\n\n\nAs tensions rise, executives remain optimistic. Plans are underway for investor workshops on “weathering protest-related turbulence” and motivational seminars titled “Why Ethics Should Never Interrupt Earnings.” Meanwhile, protesters continue to clash with law enforcement, seemingly unaware that the real tragedy is the delayed dividend payments.\nUltimately, the message to shareholders is clear: in the battle between chaos and cash, cash always wins.\n\nWhile You’re Here, Check Out Some More Stories\n\nStudy Finds Moral Outrage Reduces ROI\n\nLocal Farm Sells Soil Rights to Oil Companies\n\nProtesters Accidentally Boost Corporate Creativity\n\nCompany Converts Torn-Up Land Into Shareholder Retreat"

    "text": "Standing Rock: Protests Threaten Nation’s Bottom Line\n\nWritten by Soham Kamat\n\nSTANDING ROCK, ND — Local and national businesses are reportedly “deeply concerned” this week as the Standing Rock protests continue to delay what could have been another record-breaking quarter for corporations. Experts warn that these protests, led by people calling themselves “activists,” are standing in the way of progress, growth, and most importantly, profits.\n\n\n\nMap of the Dakota Access Pipeline route.\n\n\n“Every hour that pipeline construction is stalled, we’re losing money,” said a spokesperson for a company involved in the project. “We understand there’s an environmental impact and some people have feelings, but feelings don’t pay dividends. We just want to make America wealthy again, one oil pipeline at a time.”\nProtesters argue that the pipeline threatens water supplies and sacred lands, but corporate leaders maintain that the real tragedy is that delayed construction is bad for business. “We’ve got quarterly reports to worry about,” said another executive. “If the water is safe or if sacred sites are preserved, that’s great, but if it doesn’t fit into a profit margin, we have to reassess our priorities.”\n\n\n\nProtesters at Standing Rock.\n\n\nMeanwhile, local communities have been encouraged to “think about the bigger picture,” namely the increased stock value of oil companies and the possibility of shareholders receiving slightly higher bonuses this year. One corporate analyst noted, “We’re just trying to balance the budget here. Protecting water? Important. Protecting profits? Even more important.”\n\n\n\nFire caused by Protesters at Standing Rock.\n\n\nSome economists suggest that the protests might even inspire innovation in the private sector, such as developing pipelines that can carry oil faster or designing shareholder-friendly environmental impact studies. “If these protests have taught us anything, it’s that people are stubborn,” said the analyst. “And we can turn that stubbornness into, well, money.”\nAs the standoff continues, corporate leaders remain hopeful that eventually, the protests will realize the futility of prioritizing morality over financial gains. Until then, shareholders are urged to stay patient and remember: in the battle between ethics and earnings, earnings always win.\n\nWhile You’re Here, Check Out Some More Stories\n\nCorporation Announces Discovery of a New Mineral Called Pure Capitalism\nLocal School Sells Naming Rights to Cafeteria\n\nMan Launches Fundraiser To Raise Money For Future Fundraisers\nMayor Converts City Hall Into Luxury Hotel After Realizing It Is Prime Real Estate"
